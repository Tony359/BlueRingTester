This is not my project, it was Bob Parker's Free Ring Tester available here: https://zilogbob.com/Basic%20Digital%20Ringer/index.html

The website is not available anymore so I am sharing his FREE project here. 
[Update 23/07/25 Bob has been in touch and provided the link above - I'm leaving this Github for future reference]
